# Assignment 3 - Writeup

Assignment 3 is all about creating this natural language query system.  In order to do so, you have to write a lot of functions to retrieve infomation.  You will also have to write a function to return answers from a pattern-action list.  There is a lot of work to accomplish in this assignment, but this portion is intended for you to write about what you accomplished.

## Reflection Questions
1. In your own words describe the `search_pa_list` function.
This function loops through all of the available patterns and attempts to match the given source list with each pattern.
If one of the matterns match, it calls the function that is connected to that pattern to retrieve the information.
If no patterns match the source, it will let the uesr know that the bot didn't understand the prompt.

2. What movie did you add to the `movies.py` file?  What year was it made? Any specific reason you added that movie?
I added Iron Man wich (released in 2008) because I didn't see a lot of marvel movies in the list and I wanted to add
at least one of those. How can a movie database forget about the Marvel universe?

3. What pattern / action did you add to the paList data structure?  Why do you think that is a useful pattern / action?


4. What is chatbot would you create that would be like this?  Describe why you would create it and what it would do.


5. What was the most difficult portion of this assignment?


6. Did you write a new assert for your pattern action?
